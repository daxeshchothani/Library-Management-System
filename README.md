Setup and Installation:
-----------------------
1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository:
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd library_management

3. Create a virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   - On macOS and Linux: source venv/bin/activate

5. Install the required packages:
   pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy

6. Set up the database:
   python
   >>> from app import create_app, db
   >>> app = create_app()
   >>> with app.app_context():
   ...     db.create_all()
   >>> exit()

Running the Application:
------------------------
1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated.

2. Run the application:
   python run.py

3. The API will be available at http://localhost:5000

API Endpoints:
--------------
Books:
- GET /books: List all books
- POST /books: Create a new book
- GET /books/<book_id>: Get a specific book

Members:
- GET /members: List all members
- POST /members: Create a new member
- GET /members/<member_id>: Get a specific member

Borrowed Books:
- GET /borrowed-books: List all borrowed books
- POST /borrowed-books: Create a new borrowed book record
- GET /borrowed-books/<borrow_id>: Get a specific borrowed book record

Testing the API:
----------------
You can use tools like cURL or Postman to test the API endpoints.

Example (using cURL):
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/books \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "title": "The Great Gatsby",
       "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
       "published_date": "1925-04-10",
       "isbn": "9780743273565",
       "copies_available": 5
     }'

For more detailed information on using the API, refer to the API documentation.

Note:
-----
This is a basic implementation and does not include authentication, advanced error handling, or input validation. In a production environment, you would want to add these features for security and robustness.
